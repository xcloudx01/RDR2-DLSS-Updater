# RDR2-DLSS-Updater

Automatically copies a newer DLSS dll file to Red Dead Redemption 2's game folder for improved visual quality.

Some versions of the game re-download an older version of the DLSS file, so this script ensures you stay using a better one.

Simple script,it waits for the game to start and then copies the new dll into the directory for the game to load.
